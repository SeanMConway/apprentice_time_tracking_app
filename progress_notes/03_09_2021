Changes made: 
    - Added calendar to the month_calendar.php page. 
        - it dynamically creates on calendar based on the month and year passed in from the previous page 
    - added submit button that doesn't do anything 
    - had to style the calendar to fit 
Next Steps:
    - add some dummy data for work progress
    - pull data to display in calendar 
        - not exaclty sure how I'm going to add the work progress to the calendar...I'll need to think about this part 
    - add buttons to the calendar <td>s that will either redirect to another page or create a modal of some sort
    to fill in data 
        - I will probably have to add in more dummy data for this
