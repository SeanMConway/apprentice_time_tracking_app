progess: 
    -fixed the issue with pulling php data arrays and using it in javascript
    -this is needed to add hours to the calendar days 
    -did some styling to figure out how the hours will be displayed in the cell 
next steps: 
    -add the actual hours to the cell instead of a hardcoded number 
    -need to make the cell a button with an href (or click for a modal...not sure on this one yet)
    -need to make the submit button do something
