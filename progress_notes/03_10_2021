    - add some dummy data for work progress
        - data to "apprenticeoccupationprogresstbl"
            - occupation work process fk
            - hours 
            - date
    - pull data to display in calendar 
        - not exaclty sure how I'm going to add the work progress to the calendar...I'll need to think about this part 
    - add buttons to the calendar <td>s that will either redirect to another page or create a modal of some sort
    to fill in data 
        - I will probably have to add in more dummy data for this
